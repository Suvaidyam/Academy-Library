                <p> The Academy's Research is fundamentally aimed at generating robust, science-based evidence on natural farming and agroecology practices, with a strong emphasis on sustainability, farmer empowerment, and environmental resilience. This mission is executed through a comprehensive and collaborative approach that integrates multiple research categories and engages a diverse group of stakeholders.</p>
            
                <p>Our Academy researchers, alongside about one thousand farmer scientists, farmer mentors, and interns, are actively engaged in diverse research activities reflecting our commitment to participatory research and empowerment of the farmers. Our research efforts are carried out both independently and in collaboration with leading institutions such as ICAR, State Agricultural Universities, national and international research organizations, NGOs, and private sector partners. These partnerships enrich our work and drive innovation across five broad categories of research at the Academy. The research activities of the academy are broadly classified into 5 categories:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Farmer Scientist (FS) and Farmer Mentor (FM) Research:</b>
                    <p>Research activities carried out by FS and FM in their own field, who had officially registered under the Farmer Scientists Course (FSC)/ NF Course at RySS-Academy.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Internal and Project Linked Associates (PLA) Research:</b>
                    <p>The research activities conducted by RySS-Academy’s staff i.e., Senior Associates, PLAs, YRFs, interns, etc. The research focuses on the problems identified in the farmer’s fields in each agroclimatic zone.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Academy Farm Research:</b>
                    <p>Research activities carried out on the RySS-Academy Research farm at Pulivendula and other locations. The research primarily involves establishing models (ATM, A-grade, drought-proofing models, and experimenting on innovative models) and conducting long-term experiments.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Direct Research Grants:</b>
                    <p>Recognized institutes/Universities in their specialized themes are eligible for this award. This research is conducted in collaboration with various National and International institutes including ICAR, private organizations, NGOs, SAUs, and other research institutes</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Competitive Research Grants:</b>
                    <p>The research projects are awarded based on a competitive bidding process to various national and international institutes alone or in combinations on specific identified themes.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>  
            <p>These initiatives reflect our deep commitment to a holistic approach in sustainable natural farming-enhancing crop productivity and soil health while nurturing the well-being of communities and championing environmental conservation and climate resilience.</p>
