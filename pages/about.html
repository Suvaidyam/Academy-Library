            IGGAARL operates under the aegis of Rythu Sadhikara Samstha (RySS) in collaboration with the Government of
            Andhra Pradesh and the Government of Germany. RySS serves as the Project Executive Agent, overseeing research,
            training, and capacity-building initiatives. Main aim of IGGAARL is to co-create and share knowledge and
            practices, science and innovation to influence decision-making in agroecology. It is an institute of
            excellence of Natural Farming that will transform each village as a Climate Resilient Village. For this,
            IGGAARL facilitates empirical farmer-led research, promotes learning and innovation in the agroecology space,
            and act as a knowledge centre for upscaling and dissemination of the research findings and learning activities
            at the national as well as global level.

            <h3>History </h3>
            <p>The Indo-German Global Academy for Agroecology Research and Learning (IGGAARL) was established in 2022 at
              Pulivendula, Y.S.R. Kadapa, Andhra Pradesh. IGGAARL is an institution setup for research and learning on
              diverse themes of agroecology specifically focusing on farmer centric approach that is <b>of the farmers,
                for the farmers, and by the farmers</b>.</p>
            <p class="read-more-content">In addition to the main campus, there are 11 district-level learning centres,
              catering to localized learning needs of the 26 districts across Andhra Pradesh. These 11 centres actively
              conduct learning activities to enhance agroecological education and training. Research and training
              activities take place across various hubs in the state, ensuring widespread impact and accessibility.</p>
